# Image viewer

Opening a `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `webp` or `bmp` file shows it as an
inline image tab instead of text. Zoom
with `=`/`-`, `0`/`f` fit, `1` actual size, or `Ctrl+wheel` anchored at the
pointer (12.5%–800%) — or click the `+`, the `-` or the `0 fit` hint on the
status bar; pan with the arrows or the wheel. Shrinking averages
the pixels it covers, so a downscaled image keeps its thin lines instead of
shimmering; magnifying stays pixel-crisp.

`.svg` files are drawn by this viewer too — as a [live preview](../../../docs/editor.md#live-preview)
beside their markup — rasterized by an external converter: the
image-viewer plugin's `svgConverter` setting if you set one, otherwise `rsvg-convert`, `magick` or
`convert`, whichever is installed; the plugin's Settings page installs
`rsvg-convert` (Homebrew's `librsvg`) under **Tools**. Zooming in re-renders the drawing rather
than magnifying pixels, so it stays sharp, and the status bar reports the
document's own size (100% means 100% of the SVG). With no converter
installed — or with *Preview SVG beside its markup* turned off on the image-viewer
plugin's settings page — `.svg` opens as plain editable XML with no preview.
**Open as Text** (`Ctrl+Alt+X`, or the palette) reopens a viewer tab in the
editor — an image's bytes, or an SVG or a diagram too large to preview.

**Ctrl+two-finger-scroll on a trackpad is the pinch**: after the first notch
the zoom glides continuously toward the pointer instead of jumping between
the preset levels, while a single deliberate wheel click still snaps to the
next one. A real pinch cannot be delivered to a program running in a
terminal — the terminal receives the gesture and keeps it, usually for its
own font size, and no terminal mouse protocol can express a magnification.
If your terminal can bind a gesture to an escape sequence (iTerm2 does this
for taps and swipes), point it at whatever key `Image: Zoom In` is bound to. Images over 20 MB
or 16 megapixels are refused (the size cap is the bundled `image-viewer`
plugin's setting). The plugin is enabled by default; disabling it in Settings ▸ Plugins routes
images to the ordinary text-path refusal. Tab-switching and go-to-file keys keep working while an image is
active.

How the picture reaches the screen — pixels in a terminal that can draw
them, half-blocks everywhere else — is the same for every viewer; see
[Pictures in the terminal](../../../docs/editor.md#pictures-in-the-terminal).

## Keys

When an image tab is active:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `=` / `-` | Zoom in / out (also `Ctrl+wheel`, anchored at the pointer) |
| `0` / `f` | Fit to window |
| `1` | Actual size |
| Arrows / `Shift+arrows` | Pan |
